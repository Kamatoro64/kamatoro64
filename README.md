Currently Researching
- Infrastructure as code
- GitHub Actions vs Travis CI for CI/CD

Current Task
- [x] Merge PostgreSQL Dockerfile directly into docker-compose.yml
- [x] Node app and PostgreSQL database should run in 2 separate containers
- [x] Test cycle should be executed correctly with docker-compose up
- [x] Implement Github Actions workflow for automated-testing branch
- [x] Fix Docker volume issue -> Each test cycle should create a new Docker volume
- [ ] Optimise test cycle timings
