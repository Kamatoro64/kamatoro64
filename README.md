Welcome to my Github page!

My name is Chester and I am a IT technical consultant based in Singapore

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on an backend application to explore the software development cycle
- ðŸ”¥ Iâ€™m learning Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Automated testing, CI/CD, Cloud Services and infrastructure provisioning
- ðŸ“« I can be reached at: Discord: kageneko#2670 or Email: chester91.jp@gmail.com
- ðŸ“„ Github gists: https://gist.github.com/Kamatoro64/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee enthusiast, speak 5 languages and play the bamboo flute


Currently Researching
- Infrastructure as code
- GitHub Actions vs Travis CI for CI/CD

Current Task
- Remove PostgreSQL Dockerfile since a custom image does not need to be built
- Dockerize the Node.js app so that the automated test starts can be done in a single step. Currently only PostgreSQL database is dynamically created and discarded for each cycle
